  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

  <p>The system we are designing is for a company context with users who are employees and
    company admins managing the system. Overall, our design is inspired by SSH. We are using a combination of RSA-2048
    asymmetric protocol and Diffie-Hellman to provide mutual authentication and to come up with a shared secret,
    which is then used to produce shared symmetric keys used as session keys with AES with 256 bit keys in CBC mode.
    Public keys are verified out-of-band which is reasonable given a company scenario where out-of-band communication
    is possible and expected.
    <br>
    The threat model for this phase requires: group server and user authentication, file server and user
    authentication,
    token integrity verification and protection against passive monitoring. The system uses RSA, SHA-256, HMACs, ECC,
    and
    AES to accomplish these goals. RSA is the standard solution for the key distribution problem which the system
    uses, along
    with a Diffie-Helman exchange, to create a shared symmetric key. This allows for users and servers to communicate
    effectively
    while preserving confidentiality using AES. SHA-256 and HMAC protocol are integral to the systems protocol because
    it is used alongside RSA to ensure the integrity of the messages while in transit.

  <h2>Threat T1: Unauthorized Token Issuance</h2>
  <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
  <p>
    Threat 1 is the threat of the group server granting an illegitimate user a token they are not authorized to
    have. If this threat was left unguarded, a user Alice could request a token for a different user, such as Bob, and
    use it to get access to files she is not allowed to, undermining any sort of security function groups and tokens
    have.
    If Bob is an owner of a group, she could add other unauthorized users to a group or even delete it entirely along
    with all of its files.
    <br>
    <br>
    To make sure that tokens are only given to users that the token is assigned to, we will adopt an asymmetric
    authentication protocol. To begin, all users will be created by an admin using the “cuser” command which will
    create a username and add it to the list of users. The new user will log on to the client app with the username
    and since no RSA keypair exists for them yet, an RSA-2048 bit keypair will be created, consisting of a private,
    K<sub>u</sub><sup>-1</sup>, where u stands for user, and a public key K<sub>u</sub>.
    The keypair will be stored on the clients machine and the private key will not
    be shared or used in a way that requires it to ever sent over the network, so only the user will have it.


  We chose RSA due to the level of assurance that has been established over the years
  with its widespread use on the internet and a key size of 2048 because a 2048-bit key is the current NIST
  recommended key size. No attacks more efficient than a brute force have been found so far, and brute-forcing
  a 2048-bit key is infeasible given current computers and the poor time complexity of the fastest known factoring
  algorithm.
  <p>
    Upon the user’s first connection to the group server, the user will send their public key to the server
    which will store the public key in a list of public keys of users it keeps. A user who is able to prove they
    have the private key associated with that public key will be given access to the token associated with
    the account. Also, the first time the user connects to the group server, the server will display its
    public key to the user and, similar to SSH, the user will be responsible for verifying out-of-band
    with an Admin that the key is legitimate. The client app will maintain a list of
    public keys of servers it has connected to in the past. This is reasonable because the company setting
    means users have secure out-of-band options of getting/verifying the group server's key such as via company email
    or via physical transfer of the file using a thumb drive since the admin also works at the company. The usability
    of this system is reasonable as well because the key is cached for subsequent use, and this out-of-bound
    verification is expected to be a one time thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Establishment of a secure session over an insecure network will take place using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    adapted from the Bouncy Castle library. To initiate a connection to the server, the user will initialize a Bouncy
    Castle
    Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key generator using the "secp256r1" elliptic curve. This curve is NIST
    recommended and is in FIPS, and is generally considered safe. Some people worry that NIST may have implemented
    a back door but that is unproven and no method of introducing backdoors is currently known. Plus, it is one of
    the most commonly used curves today (Mathews).
    Once it
    is initialized, a key pair is generated giving the user a public (k<sub>ecu</sub>) and private
    (k<sub>ecu</sub>
    <super>-1</super>) key. The user will then send their public key, signed with their RSA private key,
    to the server. The group server will compare the public key to the cached public key associated with the username
    that the server stored upon the user's first connection. If the key matches, the group server will do the exact same steps,
    initializing a Bouncy Castle ECDH key generator, generating a key pair ((k<sub>ecs</sub>), k<sub>ecs</sub>
    <super>-1</super>), and sending the public key signed by its RSA private ke to the user.
    Using a key agreement, their private ECDH key, and the public ECDH key recieved from each other, the user and group
    server will
    then generate a shared secret, K<sub>ab</sub>, which will be used to derive symmetric session keys (process
    described in T3).
  </p>
  <div class="img">
    <img src="./img/handshakeA.jpg" alt="Diagram of session establishment protocol.">
  </div>

  <p>Going back to threat 1, Alice, given that she does not have access to Bob’s private key in this scenario will not
    be able to sign the ECDH public key she generated, and so the group server will not reciprocate by generating its
    own ECDH public key and will therefore not be able to derive the shared secret to be able to get Bob's token. If
    Alice attempts to login with Bob's username and generates a new keypair, the public key won't match the cached version
    and the group server will deny the request.

  <h2>Threat T2: Token Modification/Forgery</h2>

  <p>Threat 2 is the threat of a user modifying their token to grant them access to more groups/files than they should
    or forging someone else’s token to impersonate them. Under the current model, Alice could properly authenticate
    with the group server and get a token giving her access to the groups and files she is a member of. Let's say
    Alice
    has access to groups A and B as well as files 1 and 2, but then she modifies the token to also grant her access to
    group C and file 3. This
    is a problem because file 3 could contain sensitive information not meant for Alice. She could even add herself to
    the admin group and delete users, add new illegitimate users to existing groups, and, in general, wreck the entire
    system. Alice could also forge a token to look like another user to get access to the specific groups and files
    the user has access to. Also, an attacker completely unknown to the system could theoretically create a token from
    scratch that resembles the one produced by the Group server to obtain access that is unauthorized. This is
    possible
    under the current model because there is no mechanism for file servers to be able to determine whether or not a
    token has been modified since the group server issued it.

    Another issue is that tokens last indefinitely under the phase 2 model, which is problematic because users may be
    deleted but still have valid tokens they can use to access information from groups they used to be a part of. A
    user
    removed from a group could still use an old token to access the group's files.

  <p>The solution to the first half of the issue is using digital signatures to detect modified/forged tokens and
    prevent
    access when detected. The user and group server will first mutually authenticate and establish a shared secret as
    described above in Handshake A, then the user will request a token using the shared secret. The group server will
    create the token as before, but also hash the token using SHA-256 (to reduce the size) and sign the hash using its
    private RSA key K<sub>s</sub><sup>-1</sup>. It will then send the token, the signature of the token, and the HMAC of the
    message to the user. If an attacker modifies the token, the signature verification on the file server will fail and
    access will be denied.
  </p>
  <p>
    To tackle the indefinite token issue, we will add a timestamp field to the token in order to introduce and keep
    track of the expiration. Tokens expire after 1 hour to ensure users are properly authorized by the group server
    (for the demo, we will set token's to expire after 5 minutes). File servers will
    reject any expired tokens and inform the user to request a new token from the group server.
  </p>
  <p>To use the token, the user will first mutually authenticate with the file server and establish a shared secret,
    the process of which is described in threat 3. Once completed, the user will hand the token, the signature, and
    a HMAC of the message to the file server which will then compute the HMAC to verify its integrity.
    The file server will then verify the signature using the group server’s public key K<sub>s</sub>, compute the hash
    using the same algorithm as the group server, and compare the two hashes to check for a match. The file server
    will
    have access to the group server’s public key because the user who creates the file server will register it with
    the
    file server. This is reasonable because there is only one group server to register, and the public key will be
    available
    to the user, either through accessing the group server for the first time, or by contacting the admin out-of-band
    using the aforementioned channels.
    Integrity of data is largely covered here by the signature but we include the HMAC to ensure integrity of origin
    insofar
    as to make sure it is the actual user sending it, and because it keeps messages consistent because HMACs are
    necessary for other types of messages and keeping the HMAC simplifies the overall implementation.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Note: how specifially token serialization is handled in order to be able to encrypt/sign it is described
    in T4</strong></p>
  <div class="img">
    <img src="./img/token.jpg" alt="Diagram showing token acquisition protocol.">
  </div>
  <p>Now if Alice modifies a token, she will not be able to sign it because she does not have access to the group
    server’s private key. If she signs it with her own key, the file server will not be able to decrypt it with the
    group server’s public key and will refuse the token. An attacker could not forge a token or construct one
    completely from scratch either because of the same reason. If the file server can verify the signature, it can be assured
    that the token was created by the group server since the group server's public key worked and no one other than the 
    group server has the group server private key. Finally, a deleted user could not continue to use a token indefinitely either
    because it now expires.

  <h2>Threat T3: Unauthorized File Servers</h2>
  <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

  <p>Threat 3 is the threat of a user attempting to connect to a file server "s", but they connect instead to a
    malicious server impersonating "s". Under our current model, an attacker could set up a decoy server that
    impersonates a
    file server and a user could unwittingly upload sensitive files to it, essentially handing them to the attacker.
    They
    could also download a file thinking it is legitimate but instead be given malware. This is because users currently
    connect to the file server and do not authenticate it in any way, instead just blindly handing it a token and
    downloading/uploading files.
  </p>

  <p>We will secure this threat using the same approach described in T1 for the group
    server, namely Handshake A. Signing the ECDH public keys is technically unecessary because the file server
    only needs to prove they have a valid token, but we keep it for the sake of symmetry, to simplify our code, and
    because
    it will not hurt to keep it. The protocol and its algorithms with their key size choices are therefore identical.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time a user connects to a file server, it will display its public key which the user will be responsible
    for verifying
    out-of-band. This is a reasonable assumption because the system’s use-case is in a company setting where
    users can contact the file server creator to verify the key either via secure company email or physical file transfer
    using a thumb drive. The way this works is a hexstring of the public key is stored as a text file which can then be
    shared using these methods. The client app will maintain a list
    of public keys of file servers it has connected to in the past, so on subsequent connections to the file server,
    the user will know the server’s public key. Notably, however, unlike the group server, there is no need for a file
    server to cache user public keys since it gets all the verification information it needs via valid tokens.
    <br>
    Connections to a file server will be secured by doing the same method mentioned in Threat 1 with Elliptic curves
    and Diffie-Helman, see T1 for details.
  </p>

  <p> An issue with the above implementation is that asymmetric ciphers are slow and are limited in the amount of data
    they can encrypt. Therefore the rest of the session will be conducted using AES-256 symmetric key protocol with
    CBC mode and PKCS7Padding. The block mode is CBC because it is secure against replay attacks unlike ECB, and
    PKCS7Padding because it can handle different multiples of bytes and is a secure RFC standard padding scheme.
    The encryption key for the AES-256 protocol will be K<sub>e</sub> =
    SHA-256(K<sub>ab</sub> || “AES Confidentiality”).
    The integrity key will be K<sub>i</sub> = SHA-256(K<sub>ab</sub> || “AES Integrity”). AES with CBC mode requires
    generating an IV which needs to be identical for the user and the server. This is done by deriving a third key:
    K<sub>iv</sub> = SHA-256(K<sub>ab</sub> || “IV Generator”) on both the server and client end, and using the first 16
    bytes of the output as the iv. This way the entire key K<sub>ab</sub> is incorporated into the derivation even
    though we only need 16 bytes. Normally these
    symmetric keys would also concatenate an H value which is a hash of all of the messages that have taken place up
    to this
    point. This binds the mutual authentication to the session, but it is unneeded here because the Diffie-Helman key
    exchange
    already binds the session because the ECDH keypairs are thrown away right after the shared secret is created, and Kab
    is thrown away
    when the session ends. Once Ke and Ki are derived, every message sent between the client and servers will be
    encrypted
    by the sender using AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7Padding with K<sub>e</sub>.
    The sender will also create an HMAC using the message m and K<sub>i</sub>
    where HMAC(K<sub>i</sub>, m) = SHA-256( (K<sub>i</sub> ⊕ opad) || SHA-256( (K<sub>i</sub> ⊕ ipad) || m)). Because
    SHA-256 is vulnerable to extension attacks, this HMAC scheme is used to prevent an attacker from modifying the
    message
    and extending the hash.
  </p>
  <p>SHA-256 is chosen for the HMAC because it is considered cryptographically secure (meaning it offers pre-image resistance,
    second pre-image resistance, and collision resistance) and because it gives a 256-bit output which makes it easy to
    derive keys for AES-256. We could have used another secure algorithm for HMAC and SHA-256 for the key derivation,
    but that would add needless complexity.</p>
  <div>
    <strong>Please see Handshake A diagram in T1 for reference of this file server handshake.</strong>
  </div>
  <p>File server creation note: Since any random user can create file servers, the server’s name, port information,
    and whether it is trustworthy is expected to be shared/determined out-of-band. This is reasonable because the
    use-case for the system is assumed to be a company setting where contact out-of-band is possible via the secure
    channels described in T1.
  </p>
  <p>Going back to the example, a user connecting to s can now be assured they are not actually connecting to an
    impersonator because an impersonator would not be able to sign the ECDH public key they generate 
    because they will not have s’s private key. If the impersonator signs it with their own private key, the user 
    won't be able to verify the signature using the legitimate file server's public key which they have cached.

  <h2>Threat T4: Information Leakage via Passive Monitoring</h2>
  <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

  <p>Threat 4 is the threat that third party entities can listen in on communications between the client and
    group/file servers(s). Under our phase 2 model, anyone snooping on messages between the client app and servers can
    steal and use information because it is all sent in plain text. There is really no benefit to having tokens
    currently because Alice can just listen to communications between Bob and the servers to steal his token and
    impersonate him, modify messages such as tokens or files, or read every file being downloaded or uploaded.
  </p>
  <p>Many of the specific issues posed by threat 4 have already been handled by our solutions for thread 1-3. Before
    getting any token or doing any meaningful work on a server (group or file), a user uses the RSA digital signatures
    along with elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman to mutually authenticate and to establish a shared secret K<sub>ab</sub>
    which is used
    to derive AES-256 symmetric keys to provide confidentiality (with K<sub>e</sub>) and integrity (with K<sub>i</sub>)
    for all communications. This is accomplished by encrypting each envelope with K<sub>e</sub> and generating an HMAC
    on it with K<sub>i</sub>. Both the encrypted envelope and HMAC are packaged as a new object Message which means
    an eavesdropper can't learn the commands being sent between the user and the servers and cannot read the contents
    whether it is a file, a token, or something else.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to transmit objects like Token and array lists, we use Java's default serialization. In order
    to prevent attackers from modifying the serialized object to try to conduct a deserialization attack, every
    message sent across the network will have the aforementioned HMAC along with it to verify integrity. To get around Java's
    serialization being non-deterministic we verify the HMAC before deserializing so if the message is modified, it
    is never deserialized.
  </p>

  <p>Under the trust model for phase 3, group and file servers are assumed to be secure, and the only snooping threat
    is in transit. Every message passed between the user and the group server and the user and a file server are encrypted
    with K<sub>e</sub> meaning no attacker in the middle can read or steal files or tokens unless they can derive
    K<sub>e</sub>. K<sub>e</sub> is derived from K<sub>ab</sub> by concatenating K<sub>ab</sub> with a constant
    and hashing the result using SHA-256. Since SHA-256 is cryptographically secure it offers pre-image resistance
    so a passive attacker listening in would not be able to derive K<sub>ab</sub> even knowing K<sub>e</sub> and the constant.
    K<sub>ab</sub> is derived from a key-agreement using transient ECDH keypairs which in turn are derived from long term
    RSA keypairs. RSA private keys are never sent over the network, so the attacker does not have access to the server
    or user's private RSA key under this threat model, which means they cannot do these derivations to arrive at K<sub>e</sub>
    and steal a file or token. K<sub>i</sub> offers protection against an active attacker which is not currently in the
    threat model.
  </p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

  <p>These mechanisms work in tandem to ensure confidentiality and integrity while exchanging information.
    Handshake A ensures a secure key exchange between client and server while AES and HMACs ensure secure
    communication.
    This core design addresses the T1,T3 and T4 while T2 is covered by the use of a signed version of the token. Our
    group came
    to this solution by iterating upon our design with each added threat. First Handshake A as our solution to T1
    provided a basis
    for server-client key exchange. Our solution to T3 and T4 built on this idea by using AES and HMACs along with the
    shared key generated
    in Handshake A. To incorporate T2 required a modification to Handshake A for the file server and user to use in
    which the user sends a
    token signed by the group server to ensure the integrity of the token. We later addressed information leakage and
    integrity issues with
    Tokens by serializing the Token using SealObject and adding a timestamp field to Tokens for the purpose of
    tracking expiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of the design process, we initially thought about implementing a password system, and we even came up with
    a salting and hashing scheme to store passwords securely, but the fundemental issue with users tending towards picking
    poor passwords led us to abandon this avenue. We settled on Diffie-Hellman pretty quickly after that but initially
    were thinking of using modular exponentiation. However, we switched to Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman because it
    requires smaller keys which allowed us to remove a hashing step and because Bouncy Castle had a easy to use ECDH
    class. The initial curve we selected was "secp256k1", a Koblitz curve, but eventually decided against it since it does
    have some vulnerabilities that make it a few bits weaker than what we ultimately chose, "secp256r1". We also initially
    considered using Java SealedObject to serialize objects to enable encryption because it seemed from the documentation
    that it was secure, but after looking at the source code we realized it was actually using the default Java serialization.
    Instead, we decided to use the default Java serialization ourselves which gave us more flexibility, and we mitigated its
    downsides by deserializing only after verifying an HMAC.
