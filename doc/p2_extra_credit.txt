Client Swing Application

We have created a GUI version of the client application using Java Swing that showcases all commands as buttons. 
There are 2 tabs 
When each button is pressed, a small window or 2 will pop up prompting for the appropriate information based on 
what command you have selected.
    - For the prompts for connecting to both the File Server and Group Server, you will enter the server name
    in the first window (example: localhost) and then the port number in the second window.

Helpful output will display in the same window to inform you on successes and errors when running the commands.
To disconnect from the servers, the disconnect button only disconnects the client. The servers will stay running.
All of the commands are the same as the ClientTerminalApp with the exception of "help" since there are buttons to
display all commands for the user now and "q", since to exit the application the user can hit the "X" in the top
right corner.

Commands:
        relog                                                   Re-login to app, perhaps to change accounts.
        connect <-f or -g> <server> <port>                      Connect to a file or group server at the port specified.
        disconnect                                              Disconnect current connection to file and/or group server.
        group commands:                                         Must be connected to group server. Commands other than gettoken require valid token.
            gettoken                                            Fetch a token for the user that is logged in.
            cgroup <groupname>                                  Create a group named <groupname>.
            cuser <username>                                    Create a user named <username>.
            dgroup <groupname>                                  Delete the group specified by <groupname>.
            duser <username>                                    Delete the user specified by <username>.
            adduser <username> <groupname>                      Add user <username> to group <groupname>.
            ruser <username> <groupname>                        Delete user <username> from group <groupname>.
            listmembers <groupname>                             List all members of <groupname>.
        file commands:                                          Must be connected to a file server. Commands require valid tokens
            download <sourceFile> <destFile>                    Download <sourceFile> from server and saves it as <destFile>.
            upload   <srcFile> <destFile> <group>               Upload <sourceFile> to file server as a file of <group>.
            listfiles                                           List all files that the logged in user has access to via their token.
            delete <filename>                                   Delete file <filename> from server.
