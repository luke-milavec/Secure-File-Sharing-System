    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->


    <p>Our threat model adds three new threats - two different types of denial of service attacks and a file modification attack.
        The threat model allows for a user to overload the server through a process of flooding the server with 
        computationally asymmetric requests, a user or users to occupy all space on a file server by uploading one
         or more large file(s), and a file server to modify user files without detection from the user. The countermeasures
         include computational puzzles, group storage limits, file size upload limits, and the generation, storage, and verification
         of HMACs for each file stored. These countermeasures handle this new suite of threats one by one in order 
         to provide a more secure system.</p>

    <h2>Threat Model</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

    
    <p><strong>T8: Too Many User Requests</strong></p>
    <p>A user may maliciously overload the group server or file servers with requests, attempting to take up all
        server computational power to prevent legitimate users from accessing their
        services. Countermeasures must ensure that a single user with comparable physical resources as the server
        is not able to singlehandedly flood a server with so many requests that the server is unable to respond
        to other users. This threat does not encapsulate a scenario where a large number of legitimate users
        access a server at the same time causing it to become overwhelmed, or when a user with much more computational resources
        than the server (like a super computer) or multiple users conspire to send a malicious amount of requests
        – it is just stipulating that no single user should be able achieve the same thing given a similar level of
        resources as the server. </p>
    
    <p><strong>T9: File Server File Modification</strong></p>
    <p>File servers are not trusted entities so a malicious file server could modify the file without
        the user's knowledge. The counter measure should allow a legitimate user to verify the integrity of a file 
        they have access to and ensure it is the same as the one uploaded by them or another group member. This threat does not 
        encapsulate preventing the file server from making the modification, just verifying whether or not 
        a modification has been made.</p>
    <p><strong>T10: File Size Limits and Group Storage Space Limits</strong></p>
    <p> A user may maliciously attempt to upload an extremely large file and/or many files of normal size to attempt to occupy all the 
        storage space of a file server. This would lead to the inability of legitimate users to upload their files, 
        thereby conducting an attack on availability. The countermeasure must not delete files to make space, 
        since an attacker can continuously upload file(s) after deletion. This threat does not include the scenario when
        legitimate users of a lot of different groups upload a lot files and end up using the remaining 
        available storage space on the file server, but if it is predominantly one group who has used the 
        majority of the space, this is not acceptable and should be handled appropriately.

    <h2>Attacks</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
    
    <p><strong>Threat 8 Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>
        One version of the attack does not even require the user to complete a handshake with the server. 
        To conduct this attack, the user would generate a random number of length 2048 bits 
        (the same as a public key) as well as another random 256-bit number to pose as a 
        digital signature (256 bits since our signature uses SHA-256 as the hash). The user 
        would then send these 2 numbers to the server as a new connection request repeatedly. 
        This could be automated to be as fast as possible with an attack script which sends the 
        connection requests. The way our implementation works, the server would spin up a new thread 
        to handle the connection, check whether a matching public key is cached (requiring file I/O which is slow), 
        and since it would most likely not find a match, it would cache it assuming that this is a new client’s 
        first connection (which is again slow file I/O). The server would then verify the signature using the 
        given public key which will fail, so it will return an envelope with a “Fail” message. The malicious 
        user does not need to look at this response because its goal was just to make the server spin up a new 
        thread (which takes time and space) and do time-consuming file I/O and public key cryptography. Since 
        the user has to do very little work (just send connection requests) compared to the server, there 
        is a resource disparity meaning it could overwhelm the server even with a weaker system.
    </p> 
    <p>
         Along the same veins, another attack could have the user connect to a group server g, get a 
         legitimate token, connect to file server f, and have the attack script repeatedly ask to download 
         an existing file with the token (via command download &ltsrcFile&gt &ltdestFile&gt &ltgroupname&gt where 
         the srcFile and groupname are legitimate) causing the file server to have to read the entire file 
         and send it over chunk by chunk. The attacker would just ignore the server responses to save having to work.
         The attack again works because a resource disparity exists between the user and the file server 
         meaning the user has to do very little work each request (just send the download request which is one network write) 
         while the server has to do time-consuming file I/O and multiple network I/O each time. Right now, our implementation
         has no protection against attacks of this type on this command or others.
    </p> 
    <p><strong>Threat 9 Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>The attack for a file server to make modifications to a file without being detected is quite straightforward. 
        If user u uploads file f to file server s, s may modify f in order to corrupt the file, attempt to insert 
        false information, or remove information. This attack could allow for a file server to modify files 
        for any malicious purpose. This is possible because the files are stored locally on the system so the 
        file server can change anything as they please. Since f is encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode, s might 
        not be able to make targeted changes to the file, but any modifications would be undetected currently 
        by our system and the user themselves might not notice a change if the file format is unstructured to 
        begin with.</p>
    <p><strong>Threat 10 Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>The attack consisting of either a user or users uploading one or more large file(s) in order to 
        exhaust all file server storage space is currently possible. Our implementation does not prevent 
        this attack because we have no size limits on uploads. One such attack could be a user generating
        an exceedingly large file by writing random bytes to a text file and then uploading it on a file server to a 
        group their are legitimately a part of. Another version could involve generating multiple such large files
        and uploading them in a similar fashion until the file server has no more room and uploads begin to fail. 
        Multiple malicious users from a group could also upload files that end up taking up all storage space
        on the file server (the steps again would be similar).

    <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->


    <p><strong>Threat 8:</strong></p>
    <p>	To counter this threat, it is essential to even out the resource disparity between the user and the 
        server so that there isn’t a situation where the user can make the server do a lot of work based on 
        little computational investment by the user. To do this, the server will force the user to solve a 
        hash inversion computational puzzle to prove the user’s investment in the request before 
        doing any serious work. On every request, including
        the one to connect, the client will send the request to the server. The server will respond by generating the puzzle 
        and sending it to the user to solve. The user will solve it and send the solution back which the 
        server will verify before fulfilling the original request. 
    </p>
        <p>More specifically, once the request from the client is recieved, the server will pick a puzzle length
            integer n, randomly select an integer r of n bits, compute H(x) = SHA-256(r), and send over 
            n and H(x). At the moment of sending, the server will also start a timer of 3 minutes using a timestamp.
            If 3 minutes runs out before the user responds the thread will be closed. The user will
            brute force search for an n-bit number r such that SHA-256(r) = H(x). Once found, the user will
            send r to the server. The server will verify that
            the r the user returned matches with the original. If so, the server will resume and complete the rest of the
            request as normal.If not, the server will reject the request.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user could repeatedly ask for computational puzzles forcing the group server to spin up a thread
            at least and maintain the original request while it is waiting for the user to return the solution.
            So while the server would not be wasting any CPU time, it would be using up memory resources.
            The time limit of 3 minutes is there to limit the amount of threads and state the server has to maintain,
            and this limit can be adjusted based on testing to make it so a single user cannot create enough requests
            to overwhelm the memory resources of the server within the time limit. Why this was done this way over a
            stateless server approach is explained in the conclusion.
        </p>
        In order for this computational puzzle idea to work, the puzzle must have the following qualities:
        <ol>
        <li>It is easy for the server to generate - the server just has to pick a number of length n randomly and do
             one SHA-256 hash to generate H(x) which is fast.
        </li>
        <li>It is hard for the user to solve - since SHA-256 is a secure cryptographic hash it offers pre-image resistance
            meaning the user cannot easily get r from H(x). The fastest way would be to brute force it which on average would
            take the user O((2<sup>n</sup>)/2) = O(2<sup>n</sup>) (where n is the number of bits of r), 
            to compute which is exponential and slow. The value of n is set by the server to be time-consuming but not super
            slow as to make each request take unreasonably long. The exact value can be determined via testing, though it does
            rely on the assumption that clients all have relatively similar computational resources. It is hard to pick an initial
            value without implementation and testing which we are not doing this phase so a tentative starting number might be n = 11
            which would mean 2<sup>10</sup>/2 = 1024/2 = 512 guesses on average but this might be too high or low. The advantage of 
            this approach is that the difficulty is easily adjustable. 
        </li>
        <li>It is easy for the server to verify the solution - the server just has to compare two numbers to verify the puzzle.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, with a large enough n, the user is forced to invest a lot of computational time before the server has to do 
            any significant work. The result will be the elimination/reduction of the resource disparity (described above) that 
            existed between the user and server. Going back to the attack, each request by the user will take significantly more
            computational time so a single user with similar computational resources as the server will not be able to flood
            a server with too many requests like before. The time limit will prevent a user from asking for too many computational 
            puzzles. 
        </p>
    
    <p><strong>Threat 9:</strong></p>
    <p>In order to provide integrity verification on files uploaded to file servers, the user who 
        uploads the file will also send an HMAC to the file server to be verified by any other user 
        that downloads the file. The HMAC will be a HMAC(f || k) where f is the encrypted bytes of 
        the file (encrypted in the same way as described originally in T6) and k is HMAC(group key || “File Integrity”). 
        The group key will be from the keyring of the same index used to encrypt the file. 
        Like everywhere else in the project, SHA-256 will 
        be the algorithm used to generate the HMAC. The client will compute this HMAC for each chunk and concatenate the results. 
        The file server will store the HMAC in the ShareFile alongside the other metadata, and then send it to users upon completing download. Users will compute the HMAC as 
        the file is being downloaded and then verify with the HMAC stored on the file server after the download has completed.
        <br></br>
        This ensures that the file server cannot modify the file because it will result in the HMAC verification turning up false. 
        The group keys usage in the HMAC ensures the file server cannot tamper with the HMAC without corrupting its validity. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Threat 10:</strong></p>
    <p>To prevent this threat, storage space limits and file size limits upon upload must be enforced. 
        In the case for file size limits, there will be a byte limit for each upload. The file server 
        will actively monitor the bytes being received and will stop uploading if that byte limit is 
        reached. The code implementation of this can be included in FileThread.java, where the envelope 
        message received equals “UPLOADF.” In the while loop where the uploading is conducted, a 
        variable that keeps track of the bytes being received will be constantly updated. A condition 
        for the while loop will be added to check this byte limit variable while uploading is occurring. 
        Hence, once that byte limit variable is reached, the while loop will be stopped and a message 
        indicating that limit has been reached will be portrayed to the user. If the entire contents of 
        the file were not uploaded when the limit was reached, then a “FAIL” message will be sent to the 
        client side. In the edge case where the entire contents of the file were uploaded and the limit 
        was reached, neither a “FAIL” message nor a prompt will appear, since upload was successful and 
        it did not exceed the limit.
        </p>
    <p>
        In the case of storage space limits, there will be a limit on file server space for each group. 
        This will ensure groups cannot upload large amounts of files, unfairly occupying the majority 
        of the file server space. In order for the file server to enforce this limit, it must actively 
        maintain each group’s currently occupied storage spaces and their applicable limits. The file 
        server will maintain a text file for each group that is updated upon each upload and deletion 
        (adding the space used up by the upload upon successful upload and subtracting from it upon 
        successful deletion). This group storage management file will be stored locally by the file 
        server so will only be accessible by it. The limits will be hardcoded into the file server 
        in FileServer.java, so upon instantiation of a new file server, a group storage management 
        file is also created and associated with that file server and the limits will be automatically 
        written into this file once created. So the owner of the file server can decide what limit to 
        set per group. Similarly to file size limits, the code implementation for storage space limits 
        will be included in FileThread.java. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If a user requests to upload a file, their group name will also be sent in that message, 
        the file server will then check if that group has reached their limit yet by referring 
        to its group storage management file.  This check will occur in the while loop statement 
        in the “UPLOADF” message code along with the file size limit check. This ensures that 
        while a file is being uploaded, both the file size and the group storage space is continuously 
        being checked for each byte uploaded. If the group storage space limit has been reached and 
        the entire file contents were not uploaded, then a “FILE-SPACE-LIMIT-REACHED” message will 
        be sent to the client side and a prompt indicating their group storage space limit has 
        been reached will be shown to the user. The user will then be prompted with the option 
        to delete the incomplete file they attempted to upload or to keep it on the server. 
        In the edge case where the entire file contents were uploaded and the group storage 
        space limit was reached, but not exceeded, then no “FAIL” message will be sent, only 
        a prompt indicating their group storage space limit has been reached will be shown to the user. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If a user requests to delete a file, their group name will also be sent in that message, 
        the file server will then proceed to delete that file and accordingly update that group’s 
        current occupied storage space in the group storage management file upon successful deletion.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

    <p>Threat 8 and threat 10 are realistic for a real-life file sharing system. 
        Threat 8 is essentially a DOS attack, which occurs rather frequently in reality. 
        The threat 8 solution of the hash inversion computational puzzle was the most formidable solution 
        we could reasonably implement. In reality, to mitigate against this threat fully, which often takes 
        the form of a DDOS instead, requires companies to outsource the protection to a dedicated service
         such as CloudFlare, which provides active and more secure measures to prevent this type of attack.
         We, unfortunately, did not have the budget to afford this solution. Threat 10, which is the threat
         of large files exceeding file server space quickly, has a simple and effective solution by utilizing
        the upload and deletion checks. Therefore the threat is realistic, attackers could and would attempt 
        something like this in reality, and its solution is realistic to implement too.
         Threat 9 consists of protecting against a malicious file server modifying files. This is a realistic threat
         since the file server is decentralized and untrusted. HMACS are often used in reality and have the benefit of 
         being a quick way to verify no data has been corrupted, as opposed to using signatures and asymmetric cryptography.
         </p>
        <p>Originally for T10 we were considering if there was any way to prevent a rogue file server from modifying any files
         but it didn't seem possible since it can always flip bits even with an HMAC. We could only think of a solution 
         that lets the user detect any modification. For T8, we originally planned on using the stateless approach for computational
         puzzles with the server handing off the state in encrypted form to prevent attackers from using up the server's memory
         by asking for endless puzzles. However, that solution wouldn't work well from a usability standpoint
         in this context if we closed the thread and had the user re-connect, so we landed on the time limit idea instead. 
        </p>
        <p> In terms of interplay between our solutions and previous threats, the utilization of the HMAC
            interplays directly with our T6 implementation. We were already creating and managing group keys in a keyring
            so it was simple to use the group key to derive a new integrity key with most of the logistics having already been handled. 
            The sequencing of messages, implemented for Threat 5, continues to protect against any replay and reordering attacks,
            and messages are still protected from modifications. The new messages being added such as the added transmission of the
            group name in T10 still fulfill T4 since all messages are still encrypted in transit. The computational puzzle
        exchange happens before requests now, but all normal request information (once puzzle is verified) is still encrypted ike
    in the past, and the handshake is identical too.</p>
